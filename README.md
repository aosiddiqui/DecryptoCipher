# DecryptoCipher

In information security, the primary concern is protecting data against unauthorised access. Cryptography provides techniques for securing data such that only the sender and intended receiver can view its contents. Cryptanalytic attacks aim at deciphering this hidden information by guessing the plaintext or the key. In classical language modeling, deciphering historical ciphers such as substitution ciper is a challenging task. The proposed work attempts to optimize the decipher key-searching by making use of metaheuristic tool of Genetic Algorithm (GA) to perform cryptanalysis. A character-level language model that gives real words and phrases a higher log-likelihood while giving false words and sentences a low rating, has been used as the fitness function for GA.
